# Letter Detection and Recognition Game

Welcome to the Letter Detection and Recognition Game project, an educational application that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize letters from a live camera feed. This project combines the power of OpenCV for image processing and the YOLO v4 model for real-time letter detection, integrated into a Unity game environment.
## Key Features

- **Computer Vision Integration**: Utilizes [OpenCV for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-for-unity-21088) for image processing operations such as letter detection from a camera feed.
- **YOLO v4 Model**: Implements the YOLO v4 model for accurate and real-time detection of letters (A-Z).
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engages users in a game-like experience where detected letters are used in a Pictionary-style game.
- **Unity Game Engine**: Integrates with Unity for creating an immersive and interactive gameplay environment.
